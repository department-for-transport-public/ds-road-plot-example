A short example of plotting a road network and colouring it according to some data. It makes use of http://download.geofabrik.de/index.html which has converted open street map data into shapefiles

The map is crated using leaflet with R.

See [example-output.html](https://rawgit.com/departmentfortransport/ds-road-plot-example/master/example-output.html) for what the map looks like

See [plot-roads-exampple.nb.html](https://rawgit.com/departmentfortransport/ds-road-plot-example/master/plot-roads-exampple.nb.html) for the notebook containing code and output
